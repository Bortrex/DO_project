# Discrete Optimization project

The problem is related with the scheduling of exams in order
to obtain the best possible schedule for the students.

## Procedure

Please read *section 1 - Series assigment* in `statement.pdf` file.

## Results

**Note:** To consider that reading and pre-processing the data takes around 9 seconds.


### Integer Programming Model

The model follows all the formulation described in `report.pdf` file. Please, check it for details.

This model provides the following schedule:

### Heuristic

Simulated annealing - It is a metaheuristic based on local search algorithm that tries to escape from local minima.
The heuristic provides a similar result to IP model.

###### Initial attempts

This graph is the initial result of our IP model implementation. To denote how the series *SX* were randomly filled to their maximum.
